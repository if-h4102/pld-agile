# JavaFX Scene Builder

> JavaFX Scene Builder is a visual layout tool that lets users quickly design
> JavaFX application user interfaces, without coding. Users can drag and drop
> UI components to a work area, modify their properties, apply style sheets,
> and the FXML code for the layout that they are creating is automatically
> generated in the background. The result is an FXML file that can then be
> combined with a Java project by binding the UI to the application’s logic.
